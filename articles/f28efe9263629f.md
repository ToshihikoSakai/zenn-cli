# 目的

この記事では、Terraformで認証なしのCloud Runリソースを作成します。


# 手順

## terraform initの実行

```bash
terraform init
```

```bash
Terraform has made some changes to the provider dependency selections recorded
in the .terraform.lock.hcl file. Review those changes and commit them to your
version control system if they represent changes you intended to make.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

## main.tfの作成

[google_cloud_run_service](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/cloud_run_service)にて、リソースを作成します。

ここでは、以下でArtifact RegistryへデプロイしたイメージをCloud Runで起動するイメージとして指定します。

https://zenn.dev/tossy21/articles/a04412b21164ae#%E4%BD%9C%E6%88%90%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%86%E3%83%8A%E3%82%92artifact-registry%E3%81%B8push%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99

```bash
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.2.7"
}

provider "google" {
  project = "${PROJECT_ID}"
  region  = "us-central1"
  zone    = "us-central1-c"
}


resource "google_cloud_run_service" "cloud_run_instance" {
  name     = "cloud-run-instance"
  location = "us-central1"

  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = "asia-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/cloudrun-handson/sumservice:v1"
      }
    }
  }

}

data "google_iam_policy" "noauth" {
  binding {
    role = "roles/run.invoker"
    members = [
      "allUsers",
    ]
  }
}

resource "google_cloud_run_service_iam_policy" "noauth" {
  location = google_cloud_run_service.cloud_run_instance.location
  project  = google_cloud_run_service.cloud_run_instance.project
  service  = google_cloud_run_service.cloud_run_instance.name

  policy_data = data.google_iam_policy.noauth.policy_data
}

```

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/cloud_run_service#example-usage---cloud-run-service-noauth

## デプロイ

terraform planで作成されるリソースについて確認します。

```bash
terraform plan
```

```bash
data.google_iam_policy.noauth: Reading...
data.google_iam_policy.noauth: Read complete after 0s [id=xxxxxxxxxx]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_cloud_run_service.cloud_run_instance will be created
  + resource "google_cloud_run_service" "cloud_run_instance" {
      + autogenerate_revision_name = false

      + service     = "cloud-run-instance"
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

確認したら、terraform applyでデプロイします。

```bash
terraform apply
```

yesを入力し、エンターを押下します。

```bash
...

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Cloud Runリソースが作成されたことを確認します。


```bash
gcloud run services list

   SERVICE             REGION       URL                                                 LAST DEPLOYED BY         LAST DEPLOYED AT
✔  cloud-run-instance  us-central1  https://cloud-run-instance-xxxxxxxxx-uc.a.run.app  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  2023-08-03T00:42:43.164510Z
```

サービスが起動していることを確認します。

```bash
 curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"numbers": [10, 20, 30, 300, 100]}' https://cloud-run-instance-xxxxxxxxx-uc.a.run.app/sum | jq
{
  "sum": 460
}

```

確認後は、リソースを削除します。

```bash
terraform destroy
```
